#String to Cookie Converter

The String to Cookie Converter is a basic Javascript that maps URLS to Cookies using Javascript.
Users that visit a Landingpage can then be identified using the Cookie that was assigned to them.

Once the StringToCooies.js file is integrated into the Page, new Cookies can be created using url-patterns like these:
StringToCookie_Example.html?a=1&b=3&c=m2-m3-m4-m5
